## My process

### Built with  

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Learned a new CSS attribute: mix-blend-mode, which sets how an element's content should blend with the content of the element's parent and the element's background.
- In this challenge, I used 'multiply' as the mix-blend-mode value 

### Continued development

- Solve more challenges in Frontend Mentor

### Useful resources

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode - This helped me to learn about mix-blend-mode and CSS attributes in general
